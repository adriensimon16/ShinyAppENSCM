# ShinyAppENSCM

This repository contains a shiny app that I developed in the context of my Master's degree thesis in statistical analysis at the university of Montpellier during the 2022/2023 school year. This app is designed to help visualize the data that I worked with during my time as an apprentice at the Ecole sup√©rieure nationale de chimie de Montpellier (ENSCM). 

## The data

The data that is being used in this app is the compiled answers of the school's alumni to it's yearly survey. Every year the graduates from up to five years prior are being surveyed. For instance the 2022 survey contains answers of alumni from the 2017 to 2021 promotions. All the data is anonymous. 
It can be visualized from different angles :

First from the point of view of the survey. A survey year can be picked, from 2018 to 2022 and you can visualize the data of the people that answered the survey that year.

Secondly from the point of view of the promotion. The app allows you to learn about a specific promotion, for instance 2018, and you can check data from all the promotion.
